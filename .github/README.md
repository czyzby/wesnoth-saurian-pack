# Saurian Pack

A tiny [Wesnoth](https://www.wesnoth.org/) add-on that includes additional upgrades
for selected Saurian units. This modification is compatible with the default eras,
as well as all campaigns that use the official Saurians.

See the [changelog](../_changelog.md) for a list of introduced units.

If you would like to include the additional units in your add-on, see the
[modding guide](../_modding.md).
